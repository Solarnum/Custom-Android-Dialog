# Custom-Android-Dialog
There was a question on stackoverflow about making a custom dialog. Sick of sorting out some problems I was having with gradle I decided to create a project demonstrating how to do that. The question was deleted from Stack Overflow in the ~20 minutes it took me to spin this up. So, rather than my solution going to waste, hopefully this might help someone.

It's pretty straight forward and most of the relevant code can be found in [CustomDialog.java](https://github.com/Solarnum/Custom-Android-Dialog/blob/master/src/main/java/surecoat/charliebeckwith/com/myapplication/CustomDialog.java)
