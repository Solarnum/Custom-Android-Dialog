# Custom-Android-Dialog
There was a question on stackoverflow about making a custom dialog. Sick of Gradle problems I decided to create a project demonstrating how to do that. The question was deleted from Stack Overflow in the ~20 minutes it took me to spin this up, so rather than it going to waste, hopefully this might help someone.
